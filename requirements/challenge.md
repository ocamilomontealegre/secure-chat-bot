# Project: Secure Chatbot with Password Generator

## Description

Create a Secure Chatbot application in Python that includes a password generator adhering to best security practices. The chatbot can handle user queries, provide password generation, and ensure secure password practices.

## Features

### Chatbot Capabilities

- **Conversational Interface**: Build a chatbot that can handle basic user queries and provide assistance.
- **Password Generation Command**: Allow users to request password generation through the chatbot.

### Password Generator

- **Secure Password Generation**: Implement a password generator that creates strong, secure passwords.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to specify password length, use of symbols, numbers, and upper/lowercase letters.

### Security Best Practices

- **Password Strength**: Ensure generated passwords follow best practices for strength and complexity.
- **Secure Storage (Optional)**: If storing passwords or sensitive information, use proper encryption.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Activity Logging**: Log user interactions and password generation requests for auditing purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging for troubleshooting.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask/Django**: For building the web service if you want a web-based interface (Flask is simpler and lighter).
- **ChatterBot or NLTK**: For building the chatbot (ChatterBot for simplicity, NLTK for more advanced NLP).
- **Secrets Module**: For generating secure passwords.
- **Logging Module**: For activity logging.
- **Cryptography (Optional)**: For secure password storage.
